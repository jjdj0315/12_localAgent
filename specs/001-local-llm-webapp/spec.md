## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-28

- Q: Document Q&A implementation strategy - should we use simple text extraction or vector embeddings for document analysis? → A: Vector embeddings + similarity search (ChromaDB/FAISS) to properly support multi-document comparison and accurate source references (User Story 3, Acceptance Scenarios 2 & 4)
- Q: Administrator data access scope - can administrators view user conversation contents, or only metadata for storage management? → A: Metadata only (username, conversation titles, message counts, storage usage) - conversation message contents are not accessible to administrators, preserving user privacy while enabling storage management (FR-032, User Story 5)
- Q: Backup and recovery strategy for air-gapped environment - what backup requirements are needed to support 30-day continuous operation? → A: Daily automated backups + weekly full backups with minimum 30-day retention (standard government policy), stored locally on separate storage volume, with documented restore procedures for IT staff (SC-010, Assumption #8)
- Q: Document generation mode activation - how does the user explicitly request document creation to trigger the 10,000 character limit? → A: Keyword detection in user queries (Korean keywords: "문서 작성", "초안 생성", "공문", "보고서 작성", etc.) automatically activates document generation mode, maintaining natural conversation flow (FR-017)
- Q: Tag system implementation - should tags be free-form user input or administrator-defined with manual selection? → A: Administrator-defined tags with automatic matching - administrators create organization-wide tag list (e.g., departments, projects, document types), system automatically analyzes conversation content and assigns matching tags based on semantic similarity to tag names/keywords, administrators can add new tags as needed, users can manually adjust auto-assigned tags if needed (FR-016, User Story 2)
- Q: 사용자별 저장 공간 할당 정책 - 사용자가 10GB 한도를 완전히 초과하면 어떻게 처리해야 하나요? → A: 자동 정리 - 10GB 도달 시 가장 오래된 대화/문서 자동 아카이브 또는 삭제 (30일 이상 미사용), 사용자에게 정리 내역 알림 표시 (FR-020, FR-019)
- Q: 동시 세션 한도 초과 시 처리 - 사용자가 4번째 로그인을 시도하면 어떻게 처리해야 하나요? → A: 가장 오래된 세션 자동 종료 - 가장 오래 활동이 없던 세션을 자동으로 로그아웃, 해당 세션에 "다른 위치에서 로그인하여 종료되었습니다." 알림 표시 (FR-030)
- Q: 문서 업로드 범위와 수명 - 사용자가 업로드한 문서는 어느 범위에서 접근 가능해야 하나요? → A: 대화별 범위 - 각 대화마다 독립적으로 문서 업로드, 해당 대화 내에서만 참조 가능, 대화 삭제 시 문서도 함께 삭제 (FR-009, FR-019, User Story 3)
- Q: 관리자 계정 초기 생성 방법 - FR-034 초기 설정 마법사와 FR-033 DB 직접 수정 요구사항이 충돌하는데, 첫 관리자는 어떻게 생성되어야 하나요? → A: 초기 설정 마법사 예외 - 시스템 첫 실행 시에만 설정 마법사가 첫 관리자 계정 생성 허용, setup.lock 파일 생성으로 재실행 방지, 이후 추가 관리자는 데이터베이스 직접 수정으로만 생성 가능 (FR-033, FR-034)
- Q: 태그 자동 할당 실행 시점 - 시스템이 대화에 태그를 자동으로 할당하는 시점은 언제인가요? → A: 대화 생성 시 - 사용자가 첫 메시지를 보낼 때 대화 제목과 첫 메시지 내용을 분석하여 태그 자동 할당, 이후 자동 업데이트 없음 (사용자가 수동으로 태그 추가/제거 가능) (FR-016, FR-043)

### Session 2025-10-29

- Q: GPU 하드웨어 요구사항 모순 - Assumption #2는 GPU 필수라고 했지만 Dependencies는 CPU 우선/GPU 선택적이라고 명시. 실제 배포 요구사항은? → A: CPU 우선, GPU 선택 - CPU로 기본 동작 보장, GPU 있으면 가속 활용. 지자체 환경에서 GPU 서버 조달 어려움과 경량 모델(Qwen3-4B)의 CPU 작동 가능성 고려 (Assumption #2, Dependencies)
- Q: Safety Filter 모델 구체화 - "toxic-bert or similar"는 모호함. 폐쇄망 사전 다운로드를 위해 정확한 모델 이름 필요. 어떤 모델 사용? → A: unitary/toxic-bert - 다국어 지원(한국어 포함), ~400MB, CPU 호환, HuggingFace에서 다운로드 가능, 검증된 toxic content 분류 모델 (FR-050, FR-057, Dependencies)
- Q: ReAct 도구 실패 시 사용자 경험 - FR-065는 "우아하게 처리"라고만 명시. 도구 실패 시 사용자에게 어떻게 보여줄지? → A: Transparent failure - Observation에 실패 내용 표시(예: "문서를 찾을 수 없습니다"), AI가 대안 시도 또는 명확한 안내 제공. ReAct의 추론 가시성 유지하면서 실패를 숨기지 않음 (FR-065, User Story 7 Acceptance Scenario 6)
- Q: Multi-Agent Orchestrator 기본 라우팅 모드 - FR-076은 "keyword-based OR LLM-based (admin-configurable)"이라고만 명시. 시스템 기본 모드는? → A: LLM-based 기본 - 더 정확한 의도 파악, 새로운 질문 패턴에 유연 대응, 추가 LLM 호출 비용 허용. Keyword-based는 fallback 또는 관리자가 성능 최적화 시 전환 가능 (FR-070, FR-076)
- Q: LLM-based Orchestrator 프롬프트 전략 - LLM이 5개 에이전트 중 선택하도록 하는 구체적 방법은? → A: Few-shot 예시 기반 - 각 에이전트별 2-3개 대표 질문 예시를 프롬프트에 포함, 간결한 에이전트 설명과 함께 제공. 토큰 효율적이면서 높은 정확도 유지 (FR-070, FR-076, Dependencies)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

**Testing Approach**: Manual acceptance testing per user story acceptance scenarios is MANDATORY per constitution. Automated unit/integration tests are NOT required for MVP but may be added later for regression testing.

### User Story 1 - Basic Text Generation and Q&A (Priority: P1)

Government employees need to ask questions and receive AI-generated responses for routine administrative tasks such as drafting documents, answering policy questions, or getting information summaries - all within their secure network without internet access.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that provides immediate value. Employees can use the system for basic work assistance without compromising security by using external services.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a text query through the web interface and receiving a relevant response, demonstrating that the local LLM is operational and accessible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an employee is logged into the web application, **When** they type a question about administrative procedures and submit it, **Then** the system displays an answer within 10 seconds that meets quality criteria: directly related to question topic, grammatically correct Korean (맞춤법, 조사, 어미), composed of complete sentences (minimum 1), provides requested information type (e.g., procedural question → step-by-step explanation). Quality measurement method defined in SC-004
2. **Given** an employee needs to draft a formal letter, **When** they request document generation with specific parameters (recipient, purpose, tone), **Then** the system generates an appropriate draft document
3. **Given** an employee submits a query, **When** the LLM is processing, **Then** the system shows a loading indicator and does not freeze the interface
4. **Given** an employee receives a response, **When** they want to continue the conversation, **Then** they can submit follow-up questions that maintain context from previous exchanges

---

### User Story 2 - Conversation History Management (Priority: P2)

Employees need to save, retrieve, and organize their previous conversations with the LLM to reference past work, continue interrupted tasks, or share helpful responses with colleagues.

**Why this priority**: Conversation persistence adds significant value by allowing work continuity and knowledge sharing, but the system can function without it for immediate queries.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating multiple conversations, navigating away, and verifying all conversations are saved and retrievable with their full content and metadata.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an employee has completed a conversation, **When** they navigate away and return later, **Then** they can view their complete conversation history with timestamps
2. **Given** an employee has multiple saved conversations, **When** they want to find a specific past discussion, **Then** they can search or filter conversations by keywords, date, or topic
3. **Given** an employee is viewing a saved conversation, **When** they want to continue the discussion, **Then** they can resume the conversation with full context preserved
4. **Given** an employee wants to organize their work, **When** they create or view conversations, **Then** they can assign custom titles and select from administrator-defined tags to conversations for easier retrieval and filtering

---

### User Story 3 - Document Upload and Analysis (Priority: P3)

Employees need to upload documents (reports, policies, memos) and ask the LLM to analyze, summarize, or extract information from them to support their research and decision-making tasks.

**Why this priority**: This enhances the LLM's utility significantly but requires additional processing capabilities. The core Q&A functionality (P1) and conversation management (P2) provide value independently.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by uploading a sample government document, asking specific questions about its content, and verifying the LLM provides accurate answers based on the document.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an employee has a PDF or text document, **When** they upload it to the current conversation through the interface, **Then** the system processes the document and confirms it's ready for analysis within 30 seconds
2. **Given** an employee has uploaded a document to the current conversation, **When** they ask questions about its content, **Then** the LLM provides answers based on the document's information with source references
3. **Given** an employee uploads a long policy document to the current conversation, **When** they request a summary, **Then** the system generates a concise summary highlighting key points
4. **Given** an employee has uploaded multiple documents to the current conversation, **When** they ask comparative questions, **Then** the LLM can reference and compare information across all uploaded documents within that conversation (documents are not accessible from other conversations)

---

### User Story 4 - Multi-User Access with Basic Security (Priority: P4)

Multiple employees in the local government office need to access the LLM service simultaneously with individual accounts while ensuring their conversations remain private and the system remains stable.

**Why this priority**: Multi-user support is essential for organizational deployment but can be added after core functionality is proven. Initial testing can be done with a single user account.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating multiple user accounts, having them use the system simultaneously, and verifying each user only sees their own conversations and experiences responsive performance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new employee needs access, **When** an administrator creates their account, **Then** the employee can log in with their credentials and access the service
2. **Given** multiple employees are using the system, **When** each submits queries simultaneously, **Then** all users receive responses without significant performance degradation
3. **Given** an employee is logged in, **When** they view their conversation history, **Then** they only see their own conversations, not those of other users
4. **Given** an employee session is inactive for 30 minutes, **When** they attempt to interact with the system, **Then** they are required to re-authenticate

---

### User Story 5 - Administrator Dashboard and User Management (Priority: P5)

IT staff need to manage user accounts, monitor system usage, and track system health to ensure the service operates smoothly and remains available for all employees.

**Why this priority**: Administrator functions are critical for long-term operational success but not required for initial functionality testing. The system can operate with manually configured users for early validation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in as an administrator, creating/deleting user accounts, viewing usage statistics, and monitoring system health metrics without requiring the full user-facing application to be complete.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an administrator logs into the admin panel, **When** they navigate to the user management section, **Then** they see a list of all registered users with their account status and last login time
2. **Given** an administrator needs to create a new user account, **When** they enter a username and generate an initial password, **Then** the system creates the account and provides the credentials for distribution to the employee
3. **Given** an employee forgot their password, **When** an administrator resets it through the admin panel, **Then** a new temporary password is generated and the administrator can provide it to the employee
4. **Given** an employee leaves the organization, **When** an administrator disables or deletes their account, **Then** the user can no longer log in and their data is either archived or removed per policy
5. **Given** an administrator wants to monitor system usage, **When** they view the usage statistics dashboard, **Then** they see metrics including total active users, queries processed today/this week/this month, and average response times
6. **Given** an administrator wants to check system health, **When** they view the system health panel, **Then** they see server uptime, available storage space, memory usage, and LLM service status
7. **Given** system storage is running low, **When** an administrator views the storage metrics, **Then** they receive a warning and can see which users or conversations (by title, message count, storage size) are consuming the most space without viewing message contents
8. **Given** an administrator needs to organize conversation categorization, **When** they access the tag management interface, **Then** they can create new tags with names and colors, edit existing tags, view tag usage counts, and delete unused tags (with confirmation for tags in use)

---

## User Story 6 - Safety Filter for Content Moderation (Priority: P3)

Government employees need the system to automatically filter inappropriate content in both user inputs and AI responses to maintain a professional work environment and protect against data exposure.

**Why this priority**: Content filtering is important for workplace safety and data protection but the core Q&A functionality can operate without it. Should be implemented before wide deployment to prevent inappropriate usage.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting test queries containing inappropriate content (violence, sexual content, hate speech, PII) and verifying they are correctly filtered or masked, without requiring the full application to be deployed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an employee submits a query containing violent, sexual, dangerous, or hateful content, **When** the safety filter analyzes the input, **Then** the system blocks the query and displays a warning message "부적절한 내용이 감지되어 요청을 처리할 수 없습니다." (Inappropriate content detected, cannot process request.)
2. **Given** the LLM generates a response containing inappropriate content, **When** the safety filter scans the output, **Then** the system replaces the entire response with a predefined safe message "안전한 응답을 생성할 수 없습니다. 질문을 다시 작성해주세요." (Cannot generate safe response. Please rephrase your question.)
3. **Given** an employee's query or document contains personal information (주민등록번호, phone numbers, email addresses), **When** the safety filter detects PII patterns, **Then** the system automatically masks the information (e.g., 123456-******* for SSN) before processing and displays a notice "개인정보가 자동으로 마스킹되었습니다." (Personal information has been automatically masked.)
4. **Given** the safety filter blocks content or masks PII, **When** the action is logged, **Then** administrators can view filter events in the admin panel showing timestamp, user, category (violence/sexual/hate/dangerous/PII), and whether it was input or output filtering (message content not logged for privacy)
5. **Given** an administrator needs to customize filtering rules, **When** they access the safety filter management interface, **Then** they can add/remove/edit keyword patterns for each category (violence, sexual, hate, dangerous content) and adjust PII detection patterns, with changes taking effect immediately

---

## User Story 7 - ReAct Agent with Government Tools (Priority: P3)

Government employees need the AI to systematically break down complex tasks using reasoning steps and specialized tools (document search, calculations, date logic, templates) to provide accurate and traceable answers.

**Why this priority**: ReAct agent capabilities significantly enhance AI usefulness for complex government tasks, but basic Q&A (P1) provides immediate value without it. Should be implemented after core functionality is stable.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting complex queries requiring multiple steps (e.g., "Find regulation X in uploaded documents and calculate budget impact for next fiscal year") and verifying the agent shows clear reasoning steps and tool usage.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an employee asks a question requiring document lookup, **When** the ReAct agent processes the request, **Then** the agent displays its reasoning ("Thought: 업로드된 문서에서 관련 규정을 검색해야 합니다"), executes the document search tool, and shows the result before generating final answer
2. **Given** an employee requests a calculation (budget, deadline, statistics), **When** the ReAct agent processes the request, **Then** the agent uses the calculator tool with clear input/output display (e.g., "Action: 계산기(1500000 * 1.05) = 1575000") and explains the result in context
3. **Given** an employee needs to check dates or deadlines, **When** they ask about fiscal years, business days, or holiday schedules, **Then** the agent uses the date/schedule tool to calculate accurate results considering Korean holidays and government calendar rules
4. **Given** an employee requests a standard document (공문서, 보고서), **When** the ReAct agent detects the request, **Then** the agent uses the document template tool to generate structured output with appropriate headers, sections, and formatting based on government document standards
5. **Given** the ReAct agent is processing a task, **When** it completes more than 5 reasoning-action cycles, **Then** the system stops iteration and displays "작업이 너무 복잡합니다. 질문을 단순화해주세요." (Task too complex. Please simplify your question.) with a summary of steps taken so far
6. **Given** a tool execution fails (e.g., document not found, calculation error), **When** the ReAct agent receives an error, **Then** the agent displays the error in its observation and either tries an alternative approach or explains the limitation to the user
7. **Given** an administrator reviews system usage, **When** they view tool execution logs in the admin panel, **Then** they see all tool invocations with timestamps, user, tool name, input parameters, output, and execution time for audit purposes

---

## User Story 8 - Multi-Agent System for Complex Workflows (Priority: P4)

Government employees need complex tasks (like responding to citizen inquiries requiring legal research, document drafting, and review) to be automatically distributed across specialized AI agents working collaboratively.

**Why this priority**: Multi-agent orchestration provides significant productivity gains for complex workflows but requires stable foundation of P1-P3 features. Can be added after single-agent capabilities are proven.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting a complex request (e.g., "Draft a response to citizen complaint about parking policy, cite relevant ordinances, and review for accuracy") and verifying multiple agents collaborate with clear handoffs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an employee submits a citizen inquiry question, **When** the orchestrator analyzes the request, **Then** the system automatically routes it to the Citizen Support Agent, which generates a draft response considering tone, clarity, and completeness
2. **Given** an employee requests document creation (보고서, 안내문, 정책 문서), **When** the orchestrator assigns the task, **Then** the Document Writing Agent generates structured content following government document standards with appropriate sections, formatting, and professional language
3. **Given** an employee needs legal or regulatory information, **When** the orchestrator detects legal keywords, **Then** the Legal Research Agent searches uploaded regulations/ordinances, cites relevant articles with source references, and provides interpretation in plain language
4. **Given** an employee uploads statistical data or asks for data analysis, **When** the orchestrator routes to the Data Analysis Agent, **Then** the agent provides summary statistics, identifies trends, and suggests visualization approaches suitable for government reports
5. **Given** an agent generates a document or response, **When** the workflow includes a review step, **Then** the Review Agent automatically checks for errors (factual, grammatical, policy compliance), highlights potential issues, and suggests improvements
6. **Given** an employee submits a complex multi-step request (e.g., "Research policy X, draft amendment proposal, and review"), **When** the orchestrator analyzes the task, **Then** multiple agents work sequentially (Legal Research → Document Writing → Review) with each agent's output passed as input to the next, and the user sees progress indicators for each stage
7. **Given** an administrator manages the system, **When** they access the agent management interface, **Then** they can enable/disable specific agents, adjust orchestrator routing rules (keyword-based or LLM-based classification), and view agent performance metrics (task counts, average response times, error rates)
8. **Given** an employee views a multi-agent workflow result, **When** they review the response, **Then** the system clearly labels which agent contributed each section (e.g., "법규 검색 에이전트: [content]", "문서 작성 에이전트: [content]") for transparency

### Edge Cases & Error Handling

**EC-001: Response Length Limit Exceeded**
- **Scenario**: LLM generates response exceeding 4,000 character limit
- **Handling**: Truncate response at 3,900 characters, append "[응답이 길이 제한으로 잘렸습니다. 더 구체적인 질문으로 나누어 주세요.]" (Response truncated due to length limit. Please split into more specific questions.)
- **Covered by**: FR-017, T045

**EC-002: Document Processing Capacity Exceeded**
- **Scenario**: Uploaded document exceeds 50MB OR text extraction exceeds memory limits
- **Handling**: Reject upload with error message "파일이 너무 큽니다. 50MB 이하의 파일을 업로드해주세요." (File too large. Please upload files under 50MB.) OR chunk document into smaller segments for processing
- **Covered by**: FR-015, T081, T094

**EC-003: System Resource Exhaustion**
- **Scenario**: Multiple concurrent queries exceed vLLM max_num_seqs (16 concurrent requests)
- **Handling**: Queue additional requests with user message "다른 사용자의 요청을 처리 중입니다. 잠시만 기다려주세요." (Processing other users' requests. Please wait a moment.). Return 503 Service Unavailable if queue exceeds 50 requests.
- **Covered by**: T105

**EC-004: Special Characters & Multi-Language Input**
- **Scenario**: User submits query with mixed Korean/English, emojis, or special formatting
- **Handling**: Pass input directly to LLM without sanitization (Llama-3 handles Unicode). Preserve formatting in message storage and display.
- **Covered by**: FR-014, T059

**EC-005: Invalid or Corrupted File Upload**
- **Scenario**: User uploads non-PDF/DOCX/TXT file OR corrupted file
- **Handling**: Validate file type via magic number (not extension). Reject with error "지원하지 않는 파일 형식입니다. PDF, DOCX, TXT 파일만 업로드 가능합니다." (Unsupported file format. Only PDF, DOCX, TXT allowed.) If corruption detected during extraction, return error "파일이 손상되었습니다." (File is corrupted.)
- **Covered by**: FR-015, T081, T094

**EC-006: Network Interruption During Request**
- **Scenario**: User's browser loses connection to server mid-request
- **Handling**: Frontend: Display reconnection message, retry request on reconnect. Backend: Continue processing request, store result in message history so user can retrieve on reconnect.
- **Implementation**: Add reconnection logic in frontend/src/lib/api.ts, use React Query retry mechanisms
- **Covered by**: T139a

**EC-007: LLM Service Unavailable**
- **Scenario**: vLLM service crashes, restarts, or is under maintenance
- **Handling**: Return 503 Service Unavailable with message "AI 서비스가 일시적으로 사용할 수 없습니다. 잠시 후 다시 시도해주세요." (AI service temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.). Admin dashboard displays LLM service status (red indicator).
- **Covered by**: T117, T152 (health checks)

**EC-008: Sensitive Information Detection**
- **Scenario**: User uploads document or submits query potentially containing PII or classified data
- **Handling**:
  - **Basic PII masking (IN SCOPE for MVP)**: Automatically detect and mask 주민등록번호, phone numbers, email addresses in user inputs and AI outputs (covered by FR-052, Phase 8: US6 - Safety Filter, P3 priority)
  - **Advanced document classification (OUT OF SCOPE for MVP)**: No automated detection of classified markings ("대외비", "비밀", "Confidential"), document-level sensitivity scoring, or complex PII patterns beyond basic masking. Rely on user training and assumption that air-gapped environment already provides security boundary.
- **Rationale**: Basic PII masking (FR-052) is part of US6 (Safety Filter) which is P3 priority, included in Phase 2 Release (Advanced Features). Document classification is deferred to post-MVP.
- **Status**: Basic PII masking in Phase 8, advanced classification deferred to post-MVP

**EC-009: Empty or Whitespace-Only Query**
- **Scenario**: User submits empty string or whitespace-only input
- **Handling**: Client-side: disable submit button when input is empty or whitespace-only. Server-side: return 400 Bad Request if somehow submitted with error message "질문을 입력해주세요." (Please enter a question.)
- **Covered by**: FR-003

**EC-010: Duplicate Conversation Titles**
- **Scenario**: User creates multiple conversations with identical titles
- **Handling**: Allow duplicate titles (do not auto-append numbers). Users can distinguish conversations by date. Rationale: same topic may be discussed multiple times across different time periods.
- **Covered by**: FR-006, FR-016

**EC-011: Automatic Storage Cleanup**
- **Scenario**: User's storage reaches 10GB limit, triggering automatic cleanup of conversations/documents inactive for 30+ days
- **Handling**: System identifies oldest inactive items (sorted by last_accessed timestamp), deletes them until storage drops below 9GB (10% buffer), displays notification modal: "저장 공간 부족으로 30일 이상 사용하지 않은 항목을 자동으로 정리했습니다. [정리 내역 보기]" showing list of deleted items (title, last access date, size recovered).
- **Rollback Strategy** (handles database transaction vs filesystem inconsistency): Use two-phase commit approach:
  1. **Phase 1 - Mark for deletion**: Start database transaction, mark items for deletion in metadata table (status='pending_deletion'), commit transaction
  2. **Phase 2 - Delete files**: Delete actual document files from filesystem (synchronous or background job)
  3. **Phase 3 - Confirm deletion**: Start new transaction, update status='deleted' in metadata, commit transaction
  4. **On failure**: If file deletion fails in Phase 2, mark as 'deletion_failed', retry in background job (scheduled hourly). Do NOT rollback Phase 1 metadata changes - keep metadata consistent with intent.
  5. **Incomplete state recovery**: On system restart, check for items with status='pending_deletion', retry file deletion, log admin alert if failures persist after 3 retries.
- **Error display**: If cleanup fails (file deletion error, insufficient items to clean), display error: "자동 정리 중 오류가 발생했습니다. 관리자에게 문의하세요.", notify administrator with failed item IDs.
- **Edge case within edge case**: All items are recent (none >30 days old) but storage still at 10GB → Display error to user: "저장 공간이 부족합니다. 사용하지 않는 대화나 문서를 삭제해주세요." and prevent new uploads/conversations until manual deletion.
- **Covered by**: FR-020, FR-019

**EC-012: Concurrent Session Limit Exceeded**
- **Scenario**: User attempts 4th login while already having 3 active sessions
- **Handling**: Backend identifies oldest session by last_activity timestamp (last API request time), terminates that session (delete session token from database, invalidate Redis cache entry if used), allow new login to proceed. Terminated session: on next API request receives 401 Unauthorized, frontend detects and displays modal "다른 위치에서 로그인하여 종료되었습니다.", redirects to login page after 5 seconds.
- **Implementation detail**: Track last_activity timestamp on every authenticated API request. Display session info in user settings: device/browser (from User-Agent), location (if available), last activity time.
- **Covered by**: FR-030

**EC-013: Safety Filter False Positive**
- **Scenario**: Legitimate government query (e.g., about crime statistics, health policies) is incorrectly flagged as inappropriate
- **Handling**: Display filtered message with option "이 내용이 업무와 관련된 경우 [재시도]를 클릭하세요." (If this is work-related, click [Retry]). Retry bypasses rule-based filter but still applies ML model filter. Log all overrides with user ID and query for admin review. Administrators can adjust keyword rules based on false positive reports.
- **Covered by**: FR-050, FR-051, FR-055

**EC-014: PII Masking Incomplete**
- **Scenario**: Personal information in unusual format (e.g., phone number without dashes "01012345678") is not detected
- **Handling**: Support multiple PII pattern variations (주민등록번호: 6 digits + dash + 7 digits, phone: with/without dashes, email: standard regex). If undetected PII is reported by user or admin, add pattern to detection rules. Document known limitations (e.g., names cannot be auto-detected).
- **Covered by**: FR-052

**EC-015: ReAct Agent Infinite Loop**
- **Scenario**: Agent repeatedly attempts the same failed tool or gets stuck in reasoning cycle
- **Handling**: Track tool usage per request. If same tool called 3+ times with identical parameters, force stop with message "도구 실행이 반복되고 있습니다. 다른 방법을 시도해주세요." (Tool execution is repeating. Please try a different approach.). Maximum 5 reasoning cycles enforced (FR-062).
- **Covered by**: FR-062

**EC-016: Tool Execution Timeout**
- **Scenario**: Document search tool takes >30 seconds due to large corpus or complex query
- **Handling**: Set tool execution timeout at 30 seconds. If exceeded, return timeout error to agent. Agent's observation shows "도구 실행 시간 초과" (Tool execution timeout), and agent should explain limitation to user or try alternative approach.
- **Covered by**: FR-060, FR-061

**EC-017: Calculator Tool Malformed Expression**
- **Scenario**: ReAct agent generates invalid calculation expression (e.g., "계산기(1000 원 + 500 원)")
- **Handling**: Parse expressions to extract numbers only, ignore currency symbols and Korean text. If parsing fails completely, return error "잘못된 계산식입니다." (Invalid calculation expression.) to agent. Agent should reformulate or ask user for clarification.
- **Covered by**: FR-061

**EC-018: Multi-Agent Orchestrator Routing Failure**
- **Scenario**: User query is ambiguous and orchestrator cannot determine which agent to route to
- **Handling**: Default to general conversation mode (no specialized agent) and process with standard LLM. If user query explicitly mentions multiple agent domains (e.g., "Search regulations AND draft document AND review"), orchestrator creates sequential workflow automatically.
- **Covered by**: FR-070, FR-072

**EC-019: Agent Collaboration Failure**
- **Scenario**: Legal Research Agent fails (no documents found), but workflow requires its output for Document Writing Agent
- **Handling**: Each agent in workflow receives previous agent's status. If upstream agent failed, downstream agent displays error: "이전 단계가 실패하여 작업을 완료할 수 없습니다." (Cannot complete task due to previous step failure.) and explains what was attempted. User can retry with modified query.
- **Covered by**: FR-073, FR-075

**EC-020: Safety Filter Blocking Tool Output**
- **Scenario**: Document search tool returns content containing PII, which is then flagged by safety filter before returning to user
- **Handling**: Apply safety filter to tool outputs before passing to agent or user. Mask PII in tool results. If tool output is entirely inappropriate, replace with "[도구 결과에 부적절한 내용이 포함되어 필터링되었습니다.]" (Tool output contained inappropriate content and was filtered.). Agent should handle gracefully in its reasoning.
- **Covered by**: FR-050, FR-051, FR-052

#### Safety Filter Requirements (FR-050 series)

*Note: FR-051 and FR-052 are sub-requirements of FR-050's two-phase system, separated for clarity in implementation and testing*

- **FR-050** *(Parent requirement - defines filtering architecture)*: System MUST implement two-phase content filtering for both user inputs and AI responses: Phase 1 (rule-based filter using keyword matching and regex patterns for CPU execution), Phase 2 (lightweight classification model unitary/toxic-bert running on CPU with local weights), with filtering applied synchronously before LLM processing (for input) and before response delivery (for output)
- **FR-051** *(Sub-requirement of FR-050 - defines filtering categories)*: System MUST filter content across five categories: violence (폭력성), sexual content (성적 내용), dangerous content (위험한 질문), hate speech (혐오 발언), and personal information exposure (개인정보 유출), with configurable keyword lists per category managed by administrators
- **FR-052** *(Sub-requirement of FR-050 - defines PII masking patterns)*: System MUST automatically detect and mask personal information patterns: 주민등록번호 (6 digits + dash + 7 digits → 123456-*******), phone numbers (010-XXXX-XXXX or 01XXXXXXXXX → 010-****-****), email addresses (user@domain → u***@domain), with notification "개인정보가 자동으로 마스킹되었습니다." displayed to user
- **FR-053**: System MUST return filtering results with fields: is_safe (boolean), categories (list of violated categories), confidence (0-1 score from ML model if used), matched_patterns (list of triggered keywords from rule-based filter, not logged to preserve privacy)
- **FR-054**: System MUST display predefined safe messages when content is blocked: for input filtering "부적절한 내용이 감지되어 요청을 처리할 수 없습니다." (Inappropriate content detected), for output filtering "안전한 응답을 생성할 수 없습니다. 질문을 다시 작성해주세요." (Cannot generate safe response), replacing entire original content to prevent exposure
- **FR-055**: System MUST provide administrator interface for safety filter management: add/edit/remove keyword patterns per category, enable/disable categories, view filter statistics (daily counts by category for input/output), adjust confidence thresholds for ML model, with all changes taking effect immediately without restart
- **FR-056**: System MUST log all filter events to database with fields: timestamp, user_id, category, filter_type (input/output), action_taken (blocked/masked), confidence_score, but MUST NOT log actual message content for privacy protection
- **FR-057**: System MUST load all safety filter models and keyword lists locally from disk on application startup, with no external network calls required, supporting fully air-gapped deployment
- **FR-058**: System MUST allow filter bypass for false positives: display "이 내용이 업무와 관련된 경우 [재시도]를 클릭하세요." option when input is blocked, retry bypasses rule-based filter but still applies ML filter, log all bypass attempts with user_id for administrator review

#### ReAct Agent Requirements (FR-060 series)

- **FR-060**: System MUST implement ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern with loop structure: Thought (사고: LLM generates reasoning step) → Action (행동: execute tool with parameters) → Observation (관찰: display tool result) → repeat until final answer, with each step visible to user in chat interface
- **FR-061**: System MUST provide six government-specialized tools for ReAct agent:
  1. Document Search Tool: searches uploaded documents in current conversation using vector similarity, returns text snippets with source references (filename, page)
  2. Calculator Tool: evaluates mathematical expressions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentages), handles Korean currency symbols (원), returns numeric result
  3. Date/Schedule Tool: calculates business days excluding weekends/Korean public holidays, fiscal year conversions (회계연도), deadline calculations from start date + duration
  4. Data Analysis Tool: loads CSV/Excel files from uploads, provides summary statistics (mean, median, sum, count), basic filtering and grouping
  5. Document Template Tool: generates structured Korean government documents (공문서, 보고서, 안내문) with standard headers, sections, signature blocks
  6. Legal Reference Tool: searches uploaded regulations/ordinances for specific articles, returns citations with article numbers and full text
- **FR-062**: System MUST limit ReAct agent iterations: maximum 5 reasoning-action cycles per user query (default, configurable by admin), stop with message "작업이 너무 복잡합니다. 질문을 단순화해주세요." if limit reached, display summary of steps taken so far to help user reformulate
- **FR-063**: System MUST implement tool execution safety: 30-second timeout per tool call, track identical tool calls (if same tool + same parameters called 3+ times, force stop with error "도구 실행이 반복되고 있습니다."), sandbox tool execution to prevent system access beyond designated directories
- **FR-064**: System MUST display ReAct agent progress in real-time: show each Thought as italic text with "🤔 사고:" prefix, show each Action as bold with "⚙️ 행동:" prefix and tool name/parameters, show each Observation as indented block with "👁️ 관찰:" prefix and result, final answer displayed normally
- **FR-065**: System MUST handle tool execution errors gracefully with transparent failure approach: return error description to agent in Observation field (e.g., "문서를 찾을 수 없습니다"), display error in chat interface as part of ReAct flow maintaining visibility, agent must attempt alternative tool/approach OR provide clear guidance to user in Korean explaining limitation and suggesting next steps, all tool errors logged with stack traces for debugging
- **FR-066**: System MUST log all tool executions to audit trail: timestamp, user_id, conversation_id, tool_name, input_parameters (sanitized to remove PII), output_result (truncated to 500 chars), execution_time_ms, success/failure status, accessible to administrators in admin panel for audit purposes
- **FR-067**: System MUST allow administrators to enable/disable individual tools: tool management interface shows list of tools with toggle switches, disabled tools return error "이 도구는 현재 사용할 수 없습니다." if agent attempts to use them, tool availability persists across restarts

#### Multi-Agent System Requirements (FR-070 series)

- **FR-070**: System MUST implement orchestrator-based multi-agent architecture: orchestrator receives user query, analyzes intent using LLM-based classification (default mode: few-shot prompt with 2-3 example queries per agent + brief agent description for accuracy and flexibility) OR keyword matching (admin-configurable alternative for performance optimization), routes to appropriate specialized agent, returns agent output to user
- **FR-071**: System MUST provide five specialized agents, each using task-specific LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters fine-tuned for optimal performance in their domain:
  1. Citizen Support Agent (민원 지원 에이전트): analyzes citizen inquiries, generates empathetic draft responses, ensures polite tone (존댓말), checks completeness (answers all parts of inquiry)
  2. Document Writing Agent (문서 작성 에이전트): generates government documents (보고서, 안내문, 정책 문서) following standard templates, uses formal language, includes proper sections (제목, 배경, 내용, 결론)
  3. Legal Research Agent (법규 검색 에이전트): searches uploaded regulations/ordinances, cites relevant articles with source references, provides plain-language interpretation (쉬운 설명) alongside legal text
  4. Data Analysis Agent (데이터 분석 에이전트): analyzes uploaded CSV/Excel data, provides summary statistics with Korean formatting (천 단위 쉼표), identifies trends, suggests visualization types suitable for government reports
  5. Review Agent (검토 에이전트): reviews drafted content for errors (factual, grammatical, policy compliance), highlights potential issues with explanations, suggests specific improvements with examples
- **FR-071A** *(Separated from FR-071 as optional performance optimization - LoRA adapters may be removed if fine-tuning shows <10% improvement measured by 3-person blind quality evaluation (0-10 scale) on 50 test queries per agent, per plan.md LoRA Transition Decision Tree)*: System MUST implement dynamic LoRA adapter loading for multi-agent system: base model (Qwen3-4B-Instruct) loaded once on startup, each agent loads its specific LoRA adapter on first invocation with adapter caching to minimize overhead, adapter switching latency must be <3 seconds per agent invocation, LLM service uses HuggingFace PEFT library for adapter management, all LoRA adapter weights bundled locally for air-gapped deployment. **Note**: This requirement may be removed if actual fine-tuning shows <10% improvement per plan.md LoRA Transition Decision Tree
- **FR-072**: System MUST support sequential multi-agent workflows: orchestrator detects multi-step requests using keyword patterns (e.g., "검색하고... 작성하고... 검토"), creates workflow chain with agent sequence, passes each agent's output as input to next agent, displays progress indicator showing current agent and workflow stage to user
- **FR-073**: System MUST handle agent failures in workflows: if agent fails, subsequent agents receive failure notification, failed agent displays error "이전 단계가 실패하여 작업을 완료할 수 없습니다." with explanation of what was attempted, user can retry entire workflow or individual failed step
- **FR-074**: System MUST display multi-agent outputs with clear attribution: each agent's contribution labeled with agent name (e.g., "📋 문서 작성 에이전트:", "⚖️ 법규 검색 에이전트:"), visual separators between agent outputs (horizontal lines), final combined result shown at end for multi-agent workflows
- **FR-075**: System MUST track agent workflow execution: log each agent invocation with timestamp, user_id, agent_name, input_summary (first 200 chars), output_summary (first 200 chars), execution_time_ms, success/failure, for performance monitoring and debugging
- **FR-076**: System MUST provide administrator interface for agent management: enable/disable individual agents (disabled agents not available for routing), configure orchestrator routing mode (default: LLM-based classification, alternative: keyword-based rules for performance optimization), edit keyword patterns for each agent's routing rules (used when keyword mode selected), view agent performance metrics (task counts, avg response time, error rate)
- **FR-077**: System MUST implement agent context sharing: agents in same workflow share conversation context (previous messages, uploaded documents), each agent can reference previous agent outputs in the workflow, context limited to current workflow execution (not persisted across different user requests)
- **FR-078**: System MUST support parallel agent execution for independent tasks: if orchestrator detects independent sub-tasks (e.g., "Analyze data AND search regulations"), dispatch to multiple agents simultaneously, wait for all agents to complete, combine outputs in final response with clear attribution
- **FR-079**: System MUST limit agent workflow complexity: maximum 5 agents per workflow chain, maximum 3 parallel agents per request, total workflow execution timeout 5 minutes, display "작업 시간이 초과되었습니다." if timeout reached with partial results shown
- **FR-080**: System MUST load all agent implementations and routing rules locally: agent prompt templates stored in `/prompts` directory as text files, agent-specific LoRA adapter weights stored in `/models/lora_adapters/{agent_name}` directories (e.g., `/models/lora_adapters/citizen_support/`, `/models/lora_adapters/document_writing/`), routing keyword patterns stored in database or config file, no external API dependencies for agent functionality

#### Common Air-Gapped Requirements (FR-081 series)

- **FR-081**: System MUST bundle all AI models locally: base LLM model (Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct or Meta-Llama-3-8B), agent-specific LoRA adapter weights (~100-500MB per adapter, 5 adapters total for multi-agent system), safety filter model weights (unitary/toxic-bert, ~400MB), sentence-transformers embedding model for tag matching and PII detection, with all models loaded from local disk on startup without internet access
- **FR-082**: System MUST support CPU-only execution: all safety filter models must support CPU inference with acceptable latency (<2 seconds per check), ReAct tools must not require GPU, multi-agent system uses base LLM with dynamically loaded LoRA adapters (CPU-compatible via PEFT library), with optional GPU acceleration if available for faster inference and adapter switching
- **FR-083**: System MUST log all agent/tool/filter actions for audit: centralized audit log table with timestamp, user_id, action_type (filter/tool/agent), action_details (JSON), result (success/blocked/error), execution_time_ms, administrators can query logs by date range, user, or action type
- **FR-084**: System MUST allow administrators to customize all rule-based systems: safety filter keywords (add/edit/delete per category), ReAct tool availability (enable/disable), agent routing rules (keyword patterns), document templates (upload new .jinja2 files), with changes taking effect immediately or after restart (documented per feature)
- **FR-085**: System MUST provide admin dashboard section for advanced features: safety filter statistics (filter counts by category/day), ReAct tool usage statistics (per tool usage, avg time, error rate), multi-agent performance metrics (per agent task count, response time, success rate), combined into existing admin panel as new tabs
- **FR-086**: System MUST enforce resource limits for advanced features: max 10 concurrent ReAct sessions (queue additional requests), max 5 concurrent multi-agent workflows (return 503 if exceeded), safety filter timeout 2 seconds (allow message through with warning if timeout), to prevent resource exhaustion
- **FR-087**: System MUST handle graceful degradation: if safety filter model fails to load, fallback to rule-based only with warning to admin, if ReAct tools unavailable, fallback to standard LLM conversation, if multi-agent orchestrator fails, route all requests to general LLM, system remains functional even if advanced features fail
- **FR-088**: System MUST document all customization options: administrator guide includes sections for configuring safety filter rules, adding custom document templates, modifying agent routing keywords, adjusting resource limits, stored in `/docs` directory or accessible via admin panel help section

## Assumptions

This specification is based on the following assumptions:

1. **Network Environment**: The local government has an internal network infrastructure that supports web applications, even though it's isolated from the internet
2. **Hardware Resources**: Server hardware meeting minimum specifications is available:
   - **CPU** (Required): 8-core Intel Xeon or equivalent minimum, 16-core recommended for production. CPU-only deployment is the baseline configuration with acceptable performance (8-12 seconds response time per SC-001) using Qwen3-4B-Instruct (~2.5GB Q4_K_M quantization)
   - **RAM** (Required): 32GB minimum, 64GB recommended for production
   - **GPU** (Optional): NVIDIA RTX 3090 or A100 with 16GB+ VRAM and CUDA support for acceleration. GPU improves response time (3-8 seconds) and concurrent user capacity (10-16 users vs. 1-3 on CPU), but is NOT required for initial deployment
   - **Storage** (Required): 500GB+ SSD for OS/app/data, NVMe SSD 1TB recommended
   - **Network** (Required): Internal Gigabit Ethernet
3. **User Devices**: Government employees have access to computers with supported browsers (Chrome 90+, Edge 90+, Firefox 88+, minimum 1280x720 resolution, JavaScript enabled). Internet Explorer is not supported.
4. **Data Sensitivity**: While the environment is air-gapped for security, the specific classification level of data that can be processed is not defined
5. **LLM Capabilities**: Qwen3-4B-Instruct will be used as the local LLM model, providing high-quality Korean language support with Qwen2.5-72B-level performance when deployed via HuggingFace Transformers or llama.cpp with 4-bit quantization (CPU-compatible, ~2.5GB memory footprint); Qwen3-4B prioritized for optimal balance of quality and efficiency in CPU-only deployments (April 2025 release, 20-40% improvement in math/coding over Qwen2.5)
6. **User Volume & Storage**: "Small local government" implies approximately 10-50 employees who might use the system. Storage provisioning assumes 10GB per user (500GB total for 50 users), with monthly growth of 1-5GB total. Administrators responsible for storage expansion when capacity warnings occur.
7. **Authentication**: Basic username/password authentication is sufficient; advanced methods like SSO or multi-factor authentication are not required
8. **Maintenance**: Technical staff are available to perform system maintenance, updates, and user management on the local server
9. **Document Scope**: Documents processed are primarily administrative in nature (policies, reports, memos) rather than specialized technical documents
10. **Response Quality**: Users understand that local LLM responses may not match the quality of cloud-based services like ChatGPT but value the security and availability tradeoffs
11. **File Size Limits**: Document uploads will be limited to 50MB per file as a reasonable default for administrative documents

## Dependencies
