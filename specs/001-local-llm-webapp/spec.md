# Feature Specification: Local LLM Web Application for Local Government

**Feature Branch**: `001-local-llm-webapp`
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "소규모 지방자치단체 공무원 대상, 폐쇄망 환경에서 이용 가능한 Local LLM 웹 애플리케이션 서비스를 구축한다. 이는 ChatGPT, Gemini와 같은 외부 에이전트의 사용이 제한되는 환경에서 업무 지원용 LLM 기반 도구를 제공하기 위함이다."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Text Generation and Q&A (Priority: P1)

Government employees need to ask questions and receive AI-generated responses for routine administrative tasks such as drafting documents, answering policy questions, or getting information summaries - all within their secure network without internet access.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that provides immediate value. Employees can use the system for basic work assistance without compromising security by using external services.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a text query through the web interface and receiving a relevant response, demonstrating that the local LLM is operational and accessible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an employee is logged into the web application, **When** they type a question about administrative procedures and submit it, **Then** the system displays a relevant answer generated by the local LLM within 10 seconds
2. **Given** an employee needs to draft a formal letter, **When** they request document generation with specific parameters (recipient, purpose, tone), **Then** the system generates an appropriate draft document
3. **Given** an employee submits a query, **When** the LLM is processing, **Then** the system shows a loading indicator and does not freeze the interface
4. **Given** an employee receives a response, **When** they want to continue the conversation, **Then** they can submit follow-up questions that maintain context from previous exchanges

---

### User Story 2 - Conversation History Management (Priority: P2)

Employees need to save, retrieve, and organize their previous conversations with the LLM to reference past work, continue interrupted tasks, or share helpful responses with colleagues.

**Why this priority**: Conversation persistence adds significant value by allowing work continuity and knowledge sharing, but the system can function without it for immediate queries.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating multiple conversations, navigating away, and verifying all conversations are saved and retrievable with their full content and metadata.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an employee has completed a conversation, **When** they navigate away and return later, **Then** they can view their complete conversation history with timestamps
2. **Given** an employee has multiple saved conversations, **When** they want to find a specific past discussion, **Then** they can search or filter conversations by keywords, date, or topic
3. **Given** an employee is viewing a saved conversation, **When** they want to continue the discussion, **Then** they can resume the conversation with full context preserved
4. **Given** an employee wants to organize their work, **When** they create or view conversations, **Then** they can assign custom titles or tags to conversations for easier retrieval

---

### User Story 3 - Document Upload and Analysis (Priority: P3)

Employees need to upload documents (reports, policies, memos) and ask the LLM to analyze, summarize, or extract information from them to support their research and decision-making tasks.

**Why this priority**: This enhances the LLM's utility significantly but requires additional processing capabilities. The core Q&A functionality (P1) and conversation management (P2) provide value independently.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by uploading a sample government document, asking specific questions about its content, and verifying the LLM provides accurate answers based on the document.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an employee has a PDF or text document, **When** they upload it through the interface, **Then** the system processes the document and confirms it's ready for analysis within 30 seconds
2. **Given** an employee has uploaded a document, **When** they ask questions about its content, **Then** the LLM provides answers based on the document's information with source references
3. **Given** an employee uploads a long policy document, **When** they request a summary, **Then** the system generates a concise summary highlighting key points
4. **Given** an employee has uploaded multiple documents, **When** they ask comparative questions, **Then** the LLM can reference and compare information across all uploaded documents

---

### User Story 4 - Multi-User Access with Basic Security (Priority: P4)

Multiple employees in the local government office need to access the LLM service simultaneously with individual accounts while ensuring their conversations remain private and the system remains stable.

**Why this priority**: Multi-user support is essential for organizational deployment but can be added after core functionality is proven. Initial testing can be done with a single user account.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating multiple user accounts, having them use the system simultaneously, and verifying each user only sees their own conversations and experiences responsive performance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new employee needs access, **When** an administrator creates their account, **Then** the employee can log in with their credentials and access the service
2. **Given** multiple employees are using the system, **When** each submits queries simultaneously, **Then** all users receive responses without significant performance degradation
3. **Given** an employee is logged in, **When** they view their conversation history, **Then** they only see their own conversations, not those of other users
4. **Given** an employee session is inactive for 30 minutes, **When** they attempt to interact with the system, **Then** they are required to re-authenticate

---

### User Story 5 - Administrator Dashboard and User Management (Priority: P5)

IT staff need to manage user accounts, monitor system usage, and track system health to ensure the service operates smoothly and remains available for all employees.

**Why this priority**: Administrator functions are critical for long-term operational success but not required for initial functionality testing. The system can operate with manually configured users for early validation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in as an administrator, creating/deleting user accounts, viewing usage statistics, and monitoring system health metrics without requiring the full user-facing application to be complete.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an administrator logs into the admin panel, **When** they navigate to the user management section, **Then** they see a list of all registered users with their account status and last login time
2. **Given** an administrator needs to create a new user account, **When** they enter a username and generate an initial password, **Then** the system creates the account and provides the credentials for distribution to the employee
3. **Given** an employee forgot their password, **When** an administrator resets it through the admin panel, **Then** a new temporary password is generated and the administrator can provide it to the employee
4. **Given** an employee leaves the organization, **When** an administrator disables or deletes their account, **Then** the user can no longer log in and their data is either archived or removed per policy
5. **Given** an administrator wants to monitor system usage, **When** they view the usage statistics dashboard, **Then** they see metrics including total active users, queries processed today/this week/this month, and average response times
6. **Given** an administrator wants to check system health, **When** they view the system health panel, **Then** they see server uptime, available storage space, memory usage, and LLM service status
7. **Given** system storage is running low, **When** an administrator views the storage metrics, **Then** they receive a warning and can see which users or conversations are consuming the most space

### Edge Cases & Error Handling

**EC-001: Response Length Limit Exceeded**
- **Scenario**: LLM generates response exceeding 4,000 character limit
- **Handling**: Truncate response at 3,900 characters, append "[응답이 길이 제한으로 잘렸습니다. 더 구체적인 질문으로 나누어 주세요.]" (Response truncated due to length limit. Please split into more specific questions.)
- **Covered by**: FR-017, T045

**EC-002: Document Processing Capacity Exceeded**
- **Scenario**: Uploaded document exceeds 50MB OR text extraction exceeds memory limits
- **Handling**: Reject upload with error message "파일이 너무 큽니다. 50MB 이하의 파일을 업로드해주세요." (File too large. Please upload files under 50MB.) OR chunk document into smaller segments for processing
- **Covered by**: FR-015, T081, T094

**EC-003: System Resource Exhaustion**
- **Scenario**: Multiple concurrent queries exceed vLLM max_num_seqs (16 concurrent requests)

- **Covered by**: T105

**EC-004: Special Characters & Multi-Language Input**
- **Scenario**: User submits query with mixed Korean/English, emojis, or special formatting
- **Handling**: Pass input directly to LLM without sanitization (Llama-3 handles Unicode). Preserve formatting in message storage and display.
- **Covered by**: FR-014, T059

**EC-005: Invalid or Corrupted File Upload**
- **Scenario**: User uploads non-PDF/DOCX/TXT file OR corrupted file
- **Handling**: Validate file type via magic number (not extension). Reject with error "지원하지 않는 파일 형식입니다. PDF, DOCX, TXT 파일만 업로드 가능합니다." (Unsupported file format. Only PDF, DOCX, TXT allowed.) If corruption detected during extraction, return error "파일이 손상되었습니다." (File is corrupted.)

**EC-006: Network Interruption During Request**
- **Scenario**: User's browser loses connection to server mid-request
- **Handling**: Frontend: Display reconnection message, retry request on reconnect. Backend: Continue processing request, store result in message history so user can retrieve on reconnect.
- **Implementation**: Add reconnection logic in frontend/src/lib/api.ts, use React Query retry mechanisms
- **Covered by**: T139a

**EC-007: LLM Service Unavailable**
- **Scenario**: vLLM service crashes, restarts, or is under maintenance
- **Handling**: Return 503 Service Unavailable with message "AI 서비스가 일시적으로 사용할 수 없습니다. 잠시 후 다시 시도해주세요." (AI service temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.). Admin dashboard displays LLM service status (red indicator).
- **Covered by**: T117, T152 (health checks)

**EC-008: Sensitive Information Detection**
- **Scenario**: User uploads document potentially containing PII or classified data
- **Handling**: OUT OF SCOPE for MVP. No automated detection. Rely on user training and assumption that air-gapped environment already provides security boundary. Future enhancement: keyword scanning for Social Security Numbers, classified markings.
- **Status**: Deferred to post-MVP

## Assumptions

This specification is based on the following assumptions:

1. **Network Environment**: The local government has an internal network infrastructure that supports web applications, even though it's isolated from the internet
2. **Hardware Resources**: Adequate server hardware is available to run a local LLM model with acceptable performance (CPU/GPU, RAM, storage)
3. **User Devices**: Government employees have access to computers with modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
4. **Data Sensitivity**: While the environment is air-gapped for security, the specific classification level of data that can be processed is not defined
5. **LLM Capabilities**: Meta-Llama-3-8B (meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B) will be used as the local LLM model, providing reasonable quality Korean language support when deployed via vLLM inference engine
6. **User Volume & Storage**: "Small local government" implies approximately 10-50 employees who might use the system. Storage provisioning assumes 10GB per user (500GB total for 50 users), with monthly growth of 1-5GB total. Administrators responsible for storage expansion when capacity warnings occur.
7. **Authentication**: Basic username/password authentication is sufficient; advanced methods like SSO or multi-factor authentication are not required
8. **Maintenance**: Technical staff are available to perform system maintenance, updates, and user management on the local server
9. **Document Scope**: Documents processed are primarily administrative in nature (policies, reports, memos) rather than specialized technical documents
10. **Response Quality**: Users understand that local LLM responses may not match the quality of cloud-based services like ChatGPT but value the security and availability tradeoffs
11. **Browser Compatibility**: The system will support browsers that are commonly pre-installed on government workstations without requiring special plugins
12. **File Size Limits**: Document uploads will be limited to 50MB per file as a reasonable default for administrative documents

## Dependencies

- Local server infrastructure with sufficient compute resources
- Meta-Llama-3-8B model files (meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B) that support Korean language and can run on local hardware with vLLM
- Server with GPU support (NVIDIA CUDA, minimum 16GB VRAM for Llama-3-8B inference)
- Internal network with stable connectivity between employee workstations and the application server
- Browser compatibility with modern web standards for the user interface
- IT staff access to the server for initial deployment and ongoing maintenance

## Out of Scope

This feature specification explicitly excludes:

- Integration with external cloud services or APIs
- Real-time collaboration features (multiple users editing the same conversation simultaneously)
- Advanced analytics or usage reporting dashboards
- Mobile application support (tablet/smartphone apps)
- Integration with existing government IT systems (HR, document management, etc.)
- Custom LLM model training or fine-tuning on government-specific data
- Voice input/output capabilities
- Automated compliance checking or policy violation detection in responses
- Export of conversations to specific government document formats
- Version control or audit trails for document changes
- Advanced security features like encryption at rest, detailed access logs, or role-based permissions beyond basic user separation
