# Tasks: Local LLM Web Application for Local Government

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-local-llm-webapp/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the specification, so test tasks are excluded. Focus on implementation and manual testing per acceptance scenarios.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app structure**: `backend/app/`, `frontend/src/`, `llm-service/`
- All paths are relative to repository root

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion (can run parallel to US1 if staffed)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion (can run parallel to US1/US2 if staffed)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational + User Story 1 completion (needs chat functionality to test isolation)
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on Foundational completion (can run parallel to US1-4, but ideally after US1 for easier testing)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Setup)
    ‚Üì
Phase 2 (Foundational) ‚Üê CRITICAL BLOCKER
    ‚Üì
    ‚îú‚Üí Phase 3 (US1 - Basic Chat) ‚Üê MVP START HERE

    ‚îî‚Üí Phase 6 (US4 - Multi-User) [requires US1 complete]
         ‚Üì
Phase 8 (Polish)
```

### Within Each User Story

- Backend endpoints before frontend pages
- Models and schemas in Foundational phase (already created)
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase (Phase 1)**:

- T016-T021 can all run in parallel (all models, different files)
- T022-T026 can all run in parallel (all schemas, different files)
- T029, T030, T035-T038 can run in parallel (independent utilities)

**User Story 1 (Phase 3)**:
- T047, T048, T050, T051, T052 can run in parallel (frontend components, different files)

**User Story 2 (Phase 4)**:
- T068-T072 can run in parallel (frontend components, different files)

**User Story 3 (Phase 5)**:
- T082, T083, T084 can run in parallel (document extraction, different files)
- T089-T092 can run in parallel (frontend components, different files)

Task: "Create authentication context in frontend/src/lib/auth.tsx"
Task: "Create message display component in frontend/src/components/chat/MessageList.tsx"
Task: "Create message input component in frontend/src/components/chat/MessageInput.tsx"
Task: "Create loading indicator in frontend/src/components/chat/LoadingIndicator.tsx"

# These are all independent React components in different files
```

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# All SQLAlchemy models can be created in parallel:
Task: "Create User model in backend/app/models/user.py"
Task: "Create Session model in backend/app/models/session.py"
Task: "Create Conversation model in backend/app/models/conversation.py"
Task: "Create Message model in backend/app/models/message.py"
Task: "Create Document model in backend/app/models/document.py"

# All Pydantic schemas can be created in parallel:
Task: "Create auth schemas in backend/app/schemas/auth.py"
Task: "Create conversation schemas in backend/app/schemas/conversation.py"
Task: "Create message schemas in backend/app/schemas/message.py"
Task: "Create document schemas in backend/app/schemas/document.py"
Task: "Create admin schemas in backend/app/schemas/admin.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only - Fastest Path to Value)

1. **Week 1**: Complete Phase 1 (Setup) + Start Phase 2 (Foundational)
2. **Week 2-3**: Complete Phase 2 (Foundational) - CRITICAL
3. **Week 4**: Complete Phase 3 (User Story 1 - Basic Chat)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently per acceptance scenarios
5. **Deploy internally**: Get employee feedback on basic chat functionality

**Result**: Working air-gapped LLM chat application for government employees

### Incremental Delivery (Add Features Progressively)

1. **Foundation** (Weeks 1-3): Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Database, auth, models, API infrastructure ready
2. **MVP** (Week 4): User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **Deploy (Employees can now chat with LLM!)**
3. **History** (Week 5): User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (Employees can now manage conversations)
4. **Documents** (Week 6-7): User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (Employees can now analyze documents)
5. **Multi-User** (Week 8): User Story 4 ‚Üí Test with 10+ users ‚Üí Deploy (Production-ready for all employees)
6. **Administrator** (Week 9): User Story 5 ‚Üí Test admin functions ‚Üí Deploy (IT staff can manage system)
7. **Polish** (Week 10): Phase 8 ‚Üí Security, performance, docs ‚Üí **Final production release**

Each deployment adds value without breaking previous features!

### Parallel Team Strategy (3 Developers)

**Phase 1-2** (Weeks 1-3): All developers work together on Setup + Foundational
- Critical that foundation is solid before splitting work

**Phase 3+** (Weeks 4-9): Once Foundational is complete, split by user story:
- **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Chat) ‚Üí User Story 4 (Multi-User)
- **Developer B**: User Story 2 (History) ‚Üí Help with User Story 4
- **Developer C**: User Story 3 (Documents) ‚Üí User Story 5 (Administrator)

**Phase 8** (Week 10): All developers work together on Polish

**Advantages**:
- Stories complete and integrate independently
- Faster overall delivery (3 stories in parallel)
- Each developer owns end-to-end implementation of their story

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 162

**Tasks per Phase**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 8 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 30 tasks
- Phase 3 (User Story 1 - Basic Chat): 21 tasks
- Phase 4 (User Story 2 - History): 17 tasks
- Phase 5 (User Story 3 - Documents): 21 tasks
- Phase 6 (User Story 4 - Multi-User): 13 tasks
- Phase 7 (User Story 5 - Administrator): 24 tasks (added T131a, T131b, T131c for storage management)
- Phase 8 (Polish): 28 tasks (added T139a for network interruption handling)

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- 79 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (50% of total)
- After Foundational phase: 4 user stories (US1, US2, US3, US5) can be developed in parallel

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- Each user story has clear acceptance scenarios from spec.md
- Each phase checkpoint validates story independence
- No user story depends on another (except US4 on US1)

**MVP Scope**:
- Phases 1-3 only (Setup + Foundational + User Story 1)
- 59 tasks total for MVP (unchanged - new tasks are in Phase 7 and 8)
- Delivers core value: air-gapped LLM chat for government employees

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies, safe to parallelize
- **[Story] labels**: Maps tasks to user stories for traceability and independence
- **File paths**: All tasks include exact file paths for clarity
- **No test tasks**: Specification does not request TDD approach; manual testing via acceptance scenarios
- **Air-gap focus**: All dependencies bundled, no external API calls
- **Korean support**: Validated throughout (queries, responses, UI, documentation)
- **Security**: Session-based auth, user isolation, admin controls
- **Performance**: Streaming responses, async backend, optimized inference
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation, type safety, structured logging

**Commit Strategy**: Commit after each task or logical task group (e.g., all models, all schemas)

**Validation**: Stop at each phase checkpoint to validate independently per acceptance scenarios

**Avoid**: Vague tasks, same-file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
